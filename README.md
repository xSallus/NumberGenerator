#NumberGeneratorApp

A simple app that generate and displays sorts of pseudo-random numbers.

You can tell the how many numbers to generate and even set the range on which the numbers will be generated.

Obs: This app is in pre-alpha(put lots of 'pre' before 'alpha'), and maybe(read surely), have bugs(they will get rid off soon, or not so soon) and it's a little unstable.
